Sure! Here’s a simple explanation of each **Jenkins trigger** option you mentioned, with examples of when/how you’d use them:

---

### 1. **Build after other projects are built**

* **What it does:**
  Automatically triggers this project to build **after one or more specified Jenkins projects** finish building successfully.

* **Use case:**
  When you have dependent projects — e.g., build Project B only after Project A builds successfully (like building a library before an app).

* **Example:**
  Project A builds a shared library → Project B builds an app that uses that library. You configure Project B to build after Project A.

---

### 2. **Build periodically**

* **What it does:**
  Triggers builds at scheduled times using cron-like syntax.

* **Use case:**
  Run regular builds even if no code changes happen, e.g., nightly builds or daily tests.

* **Example:**
  Build every night at midnight:

  ```
  H 0 * * *
  ```

  (`H` means hash to distribute load evenly across minutes.)

---

### 3. **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**

* **What it does:**
  Jenkins listens for **webhook notifications** from GitHub. When code is pushed to GitHub, GitHub sends a message to Jenkins to start a build immediately.

* **Use case:**
  Trigger builds **instantly on code push** without polling.

* **Setup:**
  Requires configuring a webhook in your GitHub repo pointing to your Jenkins server.

* **Best for:**
  Fast, event-driven builds on GitHub commits or pull requests.

---

### 4. **Poll SCM**

* **What it does:**
  Jenkins **polls your source control (SCM) periodically** to check for changes. If changes are detected, it triggers a build.

* **Use case:**
  If webhooks are not possible or practical, Jenkins can periodically check if new commits exist.

* **Example:**
  Poll every 5 minutes:

  ```
  H/5 * * * *
  ```

* **Note:**
  Builds only trigger if changes are detected.

---

### 5. **Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)**

* **What it does:**
  Allows builds to be triggered by sending a remote HTTP request (using a special token).

* **Use case:**
  You want to trigger Jenkins builds from external systems or custom scripts.

* **How:**
  You enable this and set a token. Then curl or scripts can call:

  ```
  http://jenkins-server/job/your-job/build?token=TOKEN
  ```

---

### 6. **Pipeline**

* **What it is:**
  A **Jenkins job type** (not exactly a trigger) that uses a **Jenkinsfile** to define the entire build process, including stages and triggers.

* **Triggers in Pipeline:**
  You can specify triggers inside the `Jenkinsfile`, for example:

  ```groovy
  pipeline {
    triggers {
      pollSCM('H/5 * * * *')
      // or
      githubPush()
      // or
      cron('H 0 * * *')
    }
    // rest of pipeline
  }
  ```

* **Why use Pipeline:**
  Greater flexibility, version control your CI/CD, easier complex workflows.

| Trigger Option                         | When to Use                                       | How it works                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Build after other projects built       | Build depends on another Jenkins job              | Trigger after specified Jenkins job(s)    |
| Build periodically                     | Run builds on schedule (e.g., nightly builds)     | Uses cron syntax for timed triggers       |
| GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling | Build immediately on GitHub push                  | Webhook from GitHub triggers build        |
| Poll SCM                               | Check for code changes periodically if no webhook | Jenkins polls SCM repo, builds if changes |
| Trigger builds remotely                | External scripts/systems trigger build            | HTTP call with token triggers build       |
